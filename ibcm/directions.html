            <p>To get started programming IBCM programs, there are two documents
                (both listed on the documentation section of
                the <a href="index.html">main page</a>):
                the <a href="ibcm-poo.pdf">IBCM Principles of Operation</a> describes
                the IBCM language and all of the 16 available instructions, and
                the <a href="ibcm-code-eg.pdf">IBCM code examples</a> lists, and
                explains, two programs that have been written in IBCM. Those programs
                can be downloaded directly <a href="summation.ibcm">here</a>
                and <a href="array-summation.ibcm">here</a>.</p>

            <p>The IBCM is not a real computer, of course. Nonetheless, one can
                run programs written for it. The trick is that we have written a
                Javascript "simulator", a program that makes another computer
                behave more-or-less like the IBCM 2.2. The IBCM 2.2 simulator will
                execute all the instructions of the machine and show the contents of
                memory locations and the accumulator as it executes.</p>

            <p>To load a file, use the Browse button at the top of the
                <a href="simulator.html">simulator page</a>. Find the IBCM file,
                and click on the "Load" button. The format of your program file is
                very rigid -- the first four characters of each line are interpreted
                as a hexadecimal number. The number on the first line is loaded into
                location zero, the next into location one and so on. Characters after
                the first four on each line are ignored, so you should use them to
                comment the code. An invalid file will either not load up at all, or
                will load up gibberish.</p>

            <p>The left side of the simulator lists all the memory locations
                (using the hexadecimal address), the value in memory (if any), and the
                PC (program counter) value. Note that any blank value field is
                interpreted as'0000', as per the IBCM specification. The simulator
                leaves uninitialized values blank to increase readability.</p>

            <p>The value column consists of a series of text boxes, which allow
                you to directly edit the values in memory. The simulator will read
                the current memory location from the appropriate textbox when
                executing an instruction. You can undo any edits by using the Revert
                button, described below. The IBCM simulator does not check to ensure
                that your entered values are valid -- it is up to the user to do this.
                Note that all hexadecimal values must be 4 digits (i.e. '0000', not
                '0'), or else the simulator will not work correctly. <strong>Be sure
                    to read the section about crashing browsers and losing your work,
                    below.</strong> There is no way to save your edited work -- you will
                need to copy the changes by hand. This is party due to a browser
                limitation, and partly due to the fact that memory editing is meant to
                be a debugging tool, not a means to write entire IBCM programs from
                scratch.</p>

            <p>The 'PC' column lists the current value of the program counter. It
                can have three values. Normally, it will have a left pointing arrow
                ('&lt;-'), which indicates the <i>next</i> instruction that will be
                executed. If the simulator is waiting for input, it will have a
                capital 'I' (for Input) next to the input instruction that is
                currently awaiting a value. Lastly, if the program has halted, then a
                capital 'H' (for Halt) will be next to the halt instruction that was
                executed.</p>

            <p>On the right side, the values of the accumulator and program
                counter are listed, both in hexadecimal notation. The PC field will
                also list, next to the hexadecimal address, if the simulator is
                awaiting input or is halted. The Input box is used to read in user
                input when a program requests it. When the simulator is waiting for
                input, it will flash the 'Input' text. In addition, the simulator
                will specify which type of input is being requested: 'hex' or 'asc'
                for hexadecimal or ASCII input, respectively. Note that for entering
                a hexadecimal value, you do not need to enter all 4 digits: i.e., you
                can enter '12' instead of '0012'. This is distinctly different that
                editing memory locations (you have to enter all 4 digits for those).
                If you enter multiple characters for ASCII input, it will only read in
                the first one.</p>

            <p>Below this are four buttons. Two control execution: Run, which
                will start a program executing, and Step, which will execute a single
                instruction. Note that Run will execute until either a halt command
                is reached, or until an input command is reached. The other two
                buttons control the resetting of the IBCM program. The Reset button
                will reset the PC and accumulator, in effect allowing the program to
                run again. It will not, however, modify any memory locations. The
                Revert button will do what a Reset does, but will also reload the
                memory locations to what they were when the file was last loaded (it
                does not load the file from disk again). Thus, if you have edited any
                of the memory locations (or the IBCM program has modified them), then
                those changes will be erased on a Revert, but not on a Reset. Note
                that a Revert will not modify memory addresses outside the range that
                was loaded (i.e. any 'blank' values).</p>

            <p>Any output is displayed in the text area below these buttons. Each
                output command prints the value (hexadecimal or ASCII character) on a
                separate line.</p>

            <p>A few notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will notice a slight delay when loading the simulator page.
                    This is due to the fact that a number of scripts are run when the
                    page loads (to initialize the memory table of 4096 elements, for
                    example), and this takes a bit of time. How long this takes is
                    determined by how fast a computer it is running on (the scripts are
                    run on the client side).<br />&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Upon entering input, hitting Enter is considered the same as
                    hitting the Run button again. If you only want to execute a single
                    instruction after an input, you must click on the Step button.<br />&nbsp;</li>
                <li>The simulator does minimal error checking with the input from the
                    keyboard during program execution -- it is the user's responsibility
                    to ensure that the input is properly formatted. The only error
                    checking that is done is to ensure that a non-empty string was
                    entered (if it was, then the simulator waits for more input).<br />&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Because of the limitations of threads running in web browsers,
                    there is no native way to terminate a program that is stuck in an
                    infinite (or very long) loop -- the browser will not allow polling
                    (checking) to see if a Stop button was pressed, for example. To
                    mitigate this issue, the simulator includes a "watchdog timer" which
                    will pause execution after 1000 instructions, giving control of the
                    browser back to the user in the event of an infinite loop. The timer
                    needs to be enabled with a checkbox input at the top of the page; if
                    it is not enabled, then the browser may hang. Some browsers will
                    pause the script after a minute (or so) of execution, and ask if the
                    user wants to continue. Alternatively, you can close the web browser
                    and restart. <strong>Note that this means if you have edited any of
                        the memory locations, and your browser hangs or is restarted, you
                        will lose any and all changes you have made to the memory locations!</strong><br />&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Browser compatability: The simulator should work under any major browsers
                    released after 2018.  Note that the changing of the values
                    as the simulation is run (the PC, memory values, etc.) only works
                    under Firefox. The other browsers will have the same end state after
                    the program is run, but will not animate the execution of the IBCM
                    program when 'Run' is pressed (the 'Step' command will still animate
                    each step).<br />&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
